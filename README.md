## Two Kings

A black king and a white king are initialized on opposite ends of a 5 by 5 board. They move like regular kings in chess, except they are allowed to come next to and take each other. The player who takes his opponents king wins the game. If no one wins after 20 moves the game is a draw. Perfect play results in a draw.
